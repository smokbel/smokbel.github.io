      <h1>Force Directed Bubble chart proof of concept - D3</h1>
      <p>D3's force directed charts have always been interesting to me. They implement a velocity verlet numerical integrator to create a simplified simlulation of physical forces on particles. It assumes constant changes in time of 1, and a constant mass of 1.</p>
      <p>I thought it would be cool to test it out, and so I plotted it against Canadian youth employment data I found on <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start">Statistics Canada</a></p>
      <h1>Youth (aged 15-19) employment by type of occupation</h1>
